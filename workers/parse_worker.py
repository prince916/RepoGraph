"""Processes one claimed parse job: fetch source → build inventory (with each file's
imports, type declarations and entities) → resolve imports to edges → store them all.

All parsed rows for the job (files, edges, types, entities), plus the job's own `done` transition, are written in ONE
transaction that first deletes any rows from a previous attempt. A crash mid-parse
therefore leaves nothing behind, and a retry starts from a clean slate. The final
transition is conditioned on this attempt still owning the claim, so an attempt that
was reclaimed as stale (and possibly re-run elsewhere) can't commit over the newer one.
